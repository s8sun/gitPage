Welcome to my landing page! I'm Allan, and I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in computer engineering at UCSD. I plan to focus my study on machine learning and computer architecture later in my career. My research interests includes machine learning, computer vision, and embedded system.

In the future, I want to use my skills and heart to develope technologies that will benefits the mankind, the weak, and the underprivileged. I believe my peer engineers and I together can achieve this. As Steve Jobs once said:
>‚ÄúIt's not a faith in technology. It's faith in people.‚Äù

Undergraduate Student Researcher\
March 2020 - Present
1. Led a group of 4 student researchers on a subproject on API integration, computer vision, and face recognition by managing 
project timeline and organizing group discussions
2. Worked on a computer vision project to create saliency maps to analyze the visual tasks performed by patients during 
experiments using TensorFlow (Python) and integrated a variety of open-source algorithms such as pair-code/saliency and
DeepGazeII
3. Completed an individual computer vision project to automatically estimate pupil measurements and gaze extraction to analyze
non-volitional emotional changes using OpenCV
4. Designed gamified experiments for clinical patients to gather data for machine learning and brain machine interface studies

## Hobbies and Personal Interests
- When I'm not working or studying I like traveling (especially road trips üöó), camping in the mountains üèïÔ∏è, and hiking in the wilderness ‚õ∞Ô∏è. For me, traveling is a great way to de-stress. I'm very proud of my recent trip to Oregon and Washington. The sceneries in the national parks were astonishing. Here are some pictures of me in multiple parks. If you are into nature like me, we will likely be friends.
